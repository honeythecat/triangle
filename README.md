##Leap Year!
by Heather Anderson

A simple js app that lets a user input the lengths of the sides of a triangle and returns what type of triangle they have made: equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. It is almost like you're in high school geometry again, only without the awkwardness!

##Setup

In your browser, run:

`triangle.html`

Enjoy!

##Tests
Testing the js methods can be done via spec-runner.html.

##Known Bugs
As of latest commit: None

##Motivation

To practice writing JS apps and specs.
