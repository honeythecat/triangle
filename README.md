##TRIANGLE!
by Heather Anderson

A simple js app that lets a user input the lengths of the sides of a triangle and returns what type of triangle they have made: equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. It is almost like you're in high school geometry again, only without the awkwardness!

##Setup

In your browser, run:

`triangle.html`

Enjoy!

##Tests
Testing the js methods can be done via spec-runner.html.

##Known Bugs as of 2/13/15
As of latest commit: results won't show up in app.

##Motivation

To practice writing JS apps and specs.

Note to self: At one point you had this working today. At least you have working specs; which is pretty good for not having your pith helmet and the fact it is Friday the 13th. You'll get it.
